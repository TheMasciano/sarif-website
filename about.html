        </p>
        <p>the future holds a lot of excitement for us at Sarif Industries. We belive that advances in technology, in unison with good goverment policy and lower costs, will make Human Augmentation available to more and more people across the globe. And more accessibility to augmentation technology means a world with more opportunity.</p>
        <p>
            In the early days of Human Enhancement Technology, scientists encountered a serious obstacle: new kimbs were rejected by recipients, resulting in complete, systemic failure. Human immune systems would invariably recognize the implants as a foreing invader and attack. Darrow Industries was able to overcome this issue with the wonder drug Neuropozyne - now distributed exclusively by the Versalife Corporation. Today, Sarif Industries is working diligently to develop new technologies to reduce dependence on the drug - making augmentation safer and more affordable to the greatest possible number of people.

           No one shoud give up a normal life because of a random incident, or indeed, lose a dream over a physical limitation. So belives David Sarif, idealist, philanthropist, founder and CEO of Sarif Industries. Pursuing this belif, Mr. Sarif acquired a failing Detroit auto factory in 2007 and repurposed it for the automated manufacture of prosthetics. founding Sarif Industries.
