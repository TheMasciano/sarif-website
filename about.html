        <h1>the future holds a lot of excitement for us at Sarif Industries. We belive that advances in technology, in unison with good goverment policy and lower costs, will make Human Augmentation available to more and more people across the globe. And more accessibility to augmentation technology meand a world with more opportunity. New developments with Cosmatech Dermal Layering will help to make augmentations look and feel more natural, eliminating much of the stigma associated with Human Enhancement Technology. And for the first time ever, Omnivision Transverse Rential Technology will allow recipients to achive true stereo vision without a dedicated chip. At Sarif Industries a better tomorrow is our passion.</h1>
