            In the early days of Human Enhancement Technology, scientists encountered a serious obstacle: new kimbs were rejected by recipients, resulting in complete, systemic failure. Human immune systems would invariably recognize the implants as a foreing invader and attack. Darrow Industries was able to overcome this issue with the wonder drug Neuropozyne - now distributed exclusively by the Versalife Corporation. Today, Sarif Industries is working diligently to develop new technologies to reduce dependence on the drug - making augmentation safer and more affordable to the greatest possible number of people.

           No one shoud give up a normal life because of a random incident, or indeed, lose a dream over a physical limitation. So belives David Sarif, idealist, philanthropist, founder and CEO of Sarif Industries. Pursuing this belif, Mr. Sarif acquired a failing Detroit auto factory in 2007 and repurposed it for the automated manufacture of prosthetics. founding Sarif Industries.
